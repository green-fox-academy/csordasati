        How She Got There
      </h1>

      <h2>
        An interview with Mule Design’s Erika Hall about philosophy, phone calls and her professional journey.
      </h2>

      <p>
        <em>
          In the fall of 2013 I interviewed Erika Hall, co-founder of <a href="http://muledesign.com ">Mule Design Studio</a>, one of the most influential design practices in North America. It was the first of fourteen interviews that I would conduct for my book How They Got There: Interviews With Digital Designers About Their Careers, and so in many ways it was the most important, too.

        You studied philosophy at Dartmouth. How did you get from there into doing the kind of work that you’re doing? What was the first step?
      </p>

      <p>
        Well, let’s see, the first step was graduating into a recession with a philosophy degree [laughs].
